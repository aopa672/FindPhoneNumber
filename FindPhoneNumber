% This script prompts a user for a name (or part of a name) and then 
% searches through a list of 13 dwarves to see which ones match (ignoring
% case).  For any that match, their phone number is displayed.  
% If there are no matches then a message is displayed to indicate no 
% matches were found.

% Here is a description of how it works
% Entering the string Thorin should bring up Thorin's phone number, 
% i.e. it should display the line:
%  Name: Thorin   Number: 1777
% Entering the string fili (note lowercase f) should bring up Fili's 
% number. It should display the line:
%  Name: Fili   Number: 2777 
% Entering the string ILI (note capitals) should bring up Fili and Kili's 
% number (since both contain ili).  It should display the lines:
%  Name: Fili   Number: 2777 
%  Name: Kili   Number: 3777
% Entering the string Oin should bring up Oin and Gloin's number (since 
% both contain oin).  It should display the lines: 
%  Name: Oin   Number: 6777 
%  Name: Gloin   Number: 7777
% Entering the name Bilbo should display the line:
%  Did not find a match for Bilbo
% since that name is not in the phonebook

% set up list of names
phoneBookNames = {'Thorin','Fili','Kili','Balin','Dwalin','Oin','Gloin','Ori','Dori','Nori','Bifur','Bofur','Bombur'};

% set up list of phone numbers 
phoneBookNumber = [1777, 2777, 3777, 4777, 5777, 6777, 7777, 8777 ,9777, 1077 ,1177, 1277, 1377];
disp('Who do you want to find a phone number for?');
name = input('Please enter a name or part of a name:','s');

peopleFound = 0;
% if ( strfind(lower(phoneBookNames(i)), lower(name)) > 0 ) ;
% Entered: a, Fili, y = []
% y = length(strfind(lower(phoneBookNames(i)), lower(name));
% if(y > 0)   end

% scan through phone book and print out any matches
%i = 1
%if y == length(strfind(lower(phoneBookNames{i}), lower(name)))
%end

for i=1:length(phoneBookNames)
    currentName = phoneBookNames{i}; % get current name from cell array
        y = length(strfind(lower(currentName), lower(name)));
         if (y > 0)
         s = sprintf('Name: %s  Number: %i ', currentName,  phoneBookNumber(i));
         disp(s)
    
    peopleFound = peopleFound + 1;
         end
end

% if we didn't find anyway display a message to that effect.
if peopleFound == 0
    X = sprintf('Did not find a match for %s', name);
    disp(X);
end


disp('Done ');
